Less Unknown and Blind [REP+]

Removes Curse of the Unknown and Curse of the Blind on Chapter 4 and beyond. Why? I find them annoying, and I wanted an easy way to learn how Isaac modding works.

This won't work with challenge runs or runs with the perma-Blind/Unknown easter eggs turned on. I may update this at some point to replace the removed curse with a less annoying one instead of just completely removing it. No guarantees.
